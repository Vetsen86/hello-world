# hello-world
My very first GitHub repository!

Hi, my name is Erik, and I am a brand new programmer! I started programming in June of 2017, at the ripe old age of 29. I hope I'm' not too old to figure all this stuff out. I'm currently dipping my toes into front-end web development. I know a little HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, SASS, and JQuery. Hopefully I can eventually become a somewhat decent full-stack web developer. I know I'll never be able to compete with all the people who started programming when they were 5 (or 20 for that matter), but I hope to start a new career somewhere in the next couple years or so. Wish me luck!
